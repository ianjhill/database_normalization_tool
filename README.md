# database_normalization_tool
This Python-based project provides a complete pipeline for importing CSV data, identifying functional dependencies, performing normalization, generating SQL scripts, and building an interactive database interface.

# ðŸ“Š CSV Normalization and Database Tool

This project is a Python-based tool that guides users through the process of:
- Importing CSV data
- Identifying functional dependencies
- Performing normalization (up to BCNF)
- Generating SQL scripts
- Creating a database and providing an interactive query interface

## ðŸš€ Features

### âœ… Step 1: CSV Data Import
- Prompts the user to enter the CSV file path
- Loads the data into a Pandas DataFrame
- Displays key information:
  - Number of rows and columns
  - Sample records
  - Attribute data types

### âœ… Step 2: Functional Dependency Identification
- Allows user input for:
  - Functional Dependencies (FDs)
  - Primary Key(s)
- Performs:
  - Attribute closure computation
  - Detection of partial and transitive dependencies
  - Suggests potential candidate keys

### âœ… Step 3: Normalization Process
- Verifies if the dataset satisfies:
  - **1NF** (removes multi-valued attributes)
  - **2NF** (removes partial dependencies)
  - **3NF** (removes transitive dependencies)
  - **BCNF** (ensures all determinants are candidate keys)
- Outputs step-by-step normalization results

### âœ… Step 4: SQL Script Generation
- Generates SQL scripts to:
  - Create normalized tables
  - Populate them with data from the CSV

### âœ… Step 5: Database Creation and Query Interface
- Supports **SQLite** and **MySQL**
- Connects to a database and runs the generated SQL scripts
- Interactive interface to:
  - Insert, Update, Delete records
  - Run custom SQL queries for analysis
